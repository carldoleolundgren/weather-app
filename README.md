# About

This is an older Vue project. It pulls data from an API to display the weather. The styling is done mostly through Vuetify. It allows you to search either by locality name for places around the world or zip code for U.S. locations. 

See a live version [here](https://carldoleolundgren.github.io/weather-app/).
